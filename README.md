# Project_02_SalesAnalysis
### <b>ABOUT</b>
The company is a large bookstore chain who decided to expand their business by using eCommerce. Their approach to selling books online, based on recommendation algorithms, has led them to great success!

The IT department has given access to the sales database. It is first necessary to familiarize with the data before going further to analysis.

### <b>SKILLS ASSESSED</b>
- Describe a dataset using descriptive statistics
- Master basic statistical concepts
- Data validation/cleaning

### <b>CONDITIONS</b>
Knowledge of Python language and handling Dataframes (available through the Pandas library in Python) is required for this project. It is also demanded to know the basics of descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, graphical representations, correlation tests, bivariate analysis, etc.).

### <b>DATA</b>
The data can be accessed through this [link](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.oc-static.com/prod/courses/files/parcours-data-analyst/dataset_P4.zip), extracted directly from the company database to CSV files. Here are the files available:

- sales (referred to as "Transactions")
- list of customers
- list of products

# MISSION
### <b>Mission n°1</b>
Before geeting to the heart of the matter, the raw data needs a little cleaning! For example, making choices about treating missing values and outliers.


### <b>Mission n°2</b>
Next is to perform data analysis. A great deal of freedom is left in this regard to find the information that makes sense to understand sales better.

Used at least:
- Central tendency and dispersion indicators
- Concentration analysis via Lorenz curve and Gini index
- Graphical visualizations, including at least a histogram, a boxplot, and a time series representation
- Bivariate analyses


### <b>Mission n°3</b>
Answer questions like:

- Is there a correlation between customer gender and the categories of products purchased?
- Is there a correlation between the age of clients and:
  - Total amount of purchases
  - Purchase frequency (i.e., number of purchases per month, for example)
  - Average basket size (i.e., number of items)
  - Categories of products purchased
