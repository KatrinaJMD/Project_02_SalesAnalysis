# Project_02_SalesAnalysis

<b>CONDITIONS</b>

The requirement for this project is the knowledge of Python language and handling Dataframes (available through the Pandas library in Python). You will also need to know the basics of descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, graphical representations, correlation tests, bivariate analysis, etc.).


<b>ABOUT</b>

The company is a large bookstore chain who decided to expand their business by using eCommerce. Their approach to selling books online, based on recommendation algorithms, has led them to great success!

The IT department has given access to the sales database. It's up to you to familiarize yourself with the data and analyze it.


<b>DATA</b>

You can access the data through this link, extracted directly from the company database to CSV files. Here are the files available to you:

- sales (referred to as "Transactions")
- list of customers
- list of products


<b>Mission n°1</b>

Before you can get to the heart of the matter, you need to do a little cleaning! For example, you will have to make choices about treating missing values and outliers.


<b>Mission n°2</b>

Next, you will perform data analysis. A great deal of freedom is left to you in this regard, but it is up to you to find the information that makes sense to understand sales better.

You will need to use at least:
Central tendency and dispersion indicators
a concentration analysis via Lorenz curve and Gini index
Graphical visualizations, including at least a histogram, a boxplot, and a time series representation
Bivariate analyses


<b>Mission n°3</b>

Answer questions like:

- Is there a correlation between customer gender and the categories of products purchased?
- Is there a correlation between the age of clients and:
  - Total amount of purchases
  - Purchase frequency (i.e., number of purchases per month, for example)
  - Average basket size (i.e., number of items)
  - Categories of products purchased


<b>SKILLS ASSESSED</b>
1. Describe a dataset using descriptive statistics
2. Master basic statistical concepts
3. Clean up a dataset
